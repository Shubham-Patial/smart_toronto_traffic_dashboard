# 🚦 Smart Toronto Traffic Dashboard

**Author:** Shubham Patial
**Last Updated:** October 2025  

An interactive Streamlit dashboard analyzing Toronto’s traffic collision data — uncovering how **weather, time, and location** influence road safety and congestion.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This dashboard allows users to explore traffic collision patterns across the City of Toronto.  
You can filter by **day of week, weather condition, vehicle type**, and **neighbourhood**, and visualize:

- Crash counts by hour of day  
- Weather and injury severity impacts  
- Top neighbourhoods by collision frequency  
- Relationship between temperature and crashes  

The dashboard provides a **data-driven understanding of urban traffic safety**, helping planners, policy-makers, and residents identify high-risk conditions and areas.

## 🗃️ Data Sources

1. **City of Toronto Open Data Portal** — [Collision Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/collision-data/)  
2. **Environment Canada / OpenWeatherMap** — [Weather Data](https://openweathermap.org/)

All data were cleaned and combined into `combined.csv` using preprocessing scripts, then optionally stored in an SQLite database (`traffic.db`) for efficient querying.

## 📈 Key Insights (Example Findings)

- 🚗 Peak collisions occur between 8 AM and 6 PM (typical rush hours).  
- 🌧️ Rain and snow conditions increase accident rates by ~25–30 %.  
- 🏙️ Downtown neighbourhoods have the highest collision density.  
- 🌡️ Extreme temperatures (below 0 °C or above 30 °C) correlate with higher injury severity.  

> Actual insights depend on filter selection and latest data.

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

- **Streamlit Cloud:** Push your repo to GitHub → [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io) → Deploy.  
- **Flask + SQL backend:** Use Render or Railway for deployment if you use SQLite or another database.
